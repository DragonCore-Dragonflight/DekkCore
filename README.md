# IMPORTANT
This was my first thinking about a Dragonflight emulator. The first strategy was to port 10.1.7 DekkCore leak to future 10.2.7
In conclusion it's better to port DekkCore stuff to the later last 10.2.7 TrinityCore Source. That's why this is an archive and has the DragonCore name in it's source.
But DragonCore will be last 10.2.7 TrinityCore with ported stuff from this DekkCore leak(and maybe some other sources) and last Dragonflight RetailCore DB as database.

# DekkCore leak 10.1.7
A World of Warcraft Dragonflight emulator.

--------------

*Note:
For cpp scripts use \src\server\scripts\DekkCore\ folder!
For sql updates use sql/dragonflight/dekkcore/updates folder!
All this for being able to use db auto update & availability to merge with TrinityCore!

[Database]
Is in base folder

[Client Data]
Use extractors or Data repo

## Introduction

DragonCore is a *MMORPG* Framework based mostly in C++.

It is derived from *MaNGOS*, the *Massive Network Game Object Server*, and is
based on the code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize,
improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the in-game
mechanics and functionality.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.
